    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Jonathan Vinton. I graduated from Colorado School of
      Mines, 2019, with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. After graduating, I
      worked for the Department of Defense as an engineer for two years.
      Following that, I moved to Tanzania where I worked as a missionary
      volunteer for three years (and counting!)
    </p>
    <p>
      As you're reading this, know that I'm not interested in ceasing to be a
      missionary. This resume is being created as part of a capstone project for
      a coding class I'm currently enrolled in. However, I am interested in
      freelance work. Reach out if my skills seem relevant to you.
    </p>

      Hello! I grew up in Tanzania. My earliest memories are of my friends and I
      playing in the fields, picking fruit, and digging up peanuts! My family
      lived in the Rukwa region of Tanzania for five years before moving to the
      USA. There, I attended Trinity Lutheran for two years (best 1st and 2nd
      grade experience!) before my family moved to the Iringa region of Tanzania
      in 2005.

      When I was 13, I was asked to teach Pre-Form (pre- High School)
      Mathematics. While teaching, I also taught myself to repair laptops. At
      the time, it was very difficult to find good tech support - I knew how to
      use computers well, I was curious about how they worked, and from 20
      broken laptops, I taught myself how to repair them. Proud to say, 17 of
      them made it back into service! As a result, I taught the Introduction to
      Computer Hardware and Repair Basics at the VST College in 2015.

      After teaching for the summer, I attended Colorado School of Mines as a
      Mechancial Engineering Undergraduate. Realizing the unique opportunity, I
      took as many classes outside of my major. This includes classes on
      renewable energy, computer programming, robotics, international relations,
      etc.

      Once our class graduated in May of 2019, I took some time off before
      starting my job with the Deparment of Defense. Loved it there, great
      people to work with. Remarkable learning experience, certainly made me a
      better person. However, while working in 2021, I began to feel the desire
      to return to Tanzania as a misisonary.

      October, 2021: I signed on to be an official missionary with Village
      Schools International! I've been stationed in Tanzania for three years
      (loving it!). While there, I've taught Engineering Science and Computer
      Applications at the VST College. They have also had me train their interns
      to use computers, eventually asking me to head their (new) IT department
      as of December, 2023.

      I love life. Always seeking to find ways to develop, make the most of, and
      share my skills. The people along the way are the best part!

      <li>
        Skill-Building: whether it's learning something entirely new (like
        raising chickens) or maturing my skills (like programming), I enjoy
        reading, researching, and improving my skills.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading: I have a goal of one book per month. Really wishing I could do
        more, but time waits for no one!
      </li>
      <li>
        I'll add more later - or remove this page entirely. Right now, this is
        just in for the project's sake!
